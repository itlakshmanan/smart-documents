 * Service class responsible for payment processing operations in the Order Management Service.
 *
 * This service provides simulated payment processing functionality for demonstration purposes.
 * In a production environment, this would integrate with actual payment gateways such as:
 * - Stripe
 * - PayPal
 * - Square
 * - Adyen
 *
 * The service includes:
 * - Payment processing with configurable success rates
 * - Refund processing with configurable success rates
 * - Comprehensive logging for audit trails
 * - Exception handling for failed transactions
 *
 * @property logger Logger instance for payment operation tracking
